## Prerequisites


## Clone the Repository




## Removing Git and Creating Your Own Repo
To remove the existing Git history and create your own repository:

1. Remove the existing .git folder:
  ```bash
  rm -rf .git
  ```
2. Initialize a new Git repository:
  ```bash
  git init
  ```
3. Add all files to the new repository:
  ```bash
  git add .
  ```
4. Commit the changes
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ``` 
5. Create a new repository on GitHub (or any other platform) and follow the instructions to push your local repository.
  Make a new repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/) named `<your-project-name>`
  Now link your local project to your remote GitHub repo:
  ```bash
  git remote add origin https://github.com/<github-username>/YOUR_APP_NAME.git
  git push origin main
  ```

> ðŸš¨ Do not copy the above command. It will not work. Your GitHub username will replace `<github-username>` (including the `<` and `>`) in the URL above.
